## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See the size of the elements adjust based on their device's screen size
- Perform mathmatical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Adjust the color theme based on their preference
- **Bonus**: Have their initial theme preference checked using `prefers-color-scheme` and have any additional changes saved in the browser

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

### What I learned
#### Customizing styling Radio buttons

The design has a singular circle for the radio button, whereas the default button has something like a nested circle inside another circle. To accomplish that i used the following tutorial.
[Custom styled radio buttons](https://moderncss.dev/pure-css-custom-styled-radio-buttons/). See the example below. The `appearance: none` will remove the default radio button styles then the styles below that will create the visual custom radio button.

```css 
input[type="radio"] {
  opacity: 0;
  appearance: none;
  width: 1em;
  height: 1em;
  background: var(--main-eq-bg-color);
  border-radius: 50%;
}
```

### Useful resources

- [React + TypeScript: Working with Radio Button Groups](https://www.kindacode.com/article/react-typescript-working-with-radio-button-groups/). This showed me how to use types on elements associated with radio buttons. In this particular scenario , it was the evt.
```
const radioHandler = (event: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {
    setSelectedDrink(event.target.value);
  };
```
